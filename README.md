# PalMod
Palette-editing software for classic fighting games, mostly centered around Capcom gaes.

PalMod is the active branch.  That's where I'm releasing binaries from.  Daily betas are published to https://zachd.com/palmod/releases .

LKG is simply a mirror of the 2008 version of this code.  This was version "1.22".  There are a number of variants of 1.22: some binary hacks of it, and a couple recompiles.  In all cases I have folded every positive change I know of into the active branch.  There is also a very similar version of "1.22" at DrewDos's PalMod branch on GitHub.
